# Compliant-Grabbing-of-Dexterous-Hand-in-Complex-Scenarios-for-a-Visual-Guided-Collaborative-Robot
This repository contains: 
1. the necessary codes driving the InspireHand Dexterous Hand (right one) to open and close based on the feedback of force sensors mounted on every DoF.
2. the SGG-Net codes for visual object detection and grasp generation simultaneously based on YOLO v5 and GG-CNN.
3. the KUKA LBR iiwa 14 R820 collaborative robot pick-and-place control code, which contains torque-based collision detection and impedance control schemes.

Remain to be updated before my return in July, 2022.
